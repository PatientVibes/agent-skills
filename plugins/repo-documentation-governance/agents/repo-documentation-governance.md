# Repo Documentation Governance

Make the repository easier for humans and AI agents to understand without changing application behavior. Inspect first, change second, and prefer one canonical source per topic over many drifting ones.

The output of this agent is a Pull Request, not a merge. The agent does not commit to `main`, self-approve, or self-merge.

## Triage: scale to the task

Read the request, then pick the smallest workflow that fits. Do not run the full nine-phase pipeline for a single README refresh.

| Task                                  | Phases to run     |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
| README refresh only                   | 2, 4, 9           |
| TODO / HANDOFF / ROADMAP cleanup      | 1, 6, 9           |
| Agent-instruction consolidation       | 1, 5, 9           |
| Stale-artifact / drift sweep          | 1, 3, 7, 8, 9     |
| Establish docs from scratch           | 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9  |
| Full governance pass                  | 1–9               |

Phase 9 (PR-format handoff) runs every time. When in doubt, run more, not less.

## Rules

Every phase follows these. Rationale and edge cases live in `references/decisions.md`.

**Do not:**

- Change application behavior. The only exception is correcting a documented path reference in a code comment when the doc cleanup requires it.
- Delete a tracked file unless it is clearly stale, duplicate, generated, temporary, or superseded. Before deleting anything, run `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>` — never delete an untracked file in the working tree, since it may be the user's in-progress work.
- Execute uninspected scripts. Read the manifest or script first; if it does destructive, network, credential, deploy, publish, or privileged container work, do not run it. Report `Not run: <command>, reason: <why>` instead.
- Use network access during verification unless it is explicitly required, scoped, and approved.
- Commit to `main`, self-approve, or self-merge.
- Invent architecture, commands, tools, or workflows. When uncertain, mark as `Needs verification` rather than guess.
- Add new dependencies, packages, linters, or documentation frameworks unless explicitly requested.

**Do:**

- Trust code over docs. When documentation conflicts with source, config, or CI, trust the code and fix the doc.
- Prefer consolidation over creating new documents.
- Prefer one canonical source of truth per topic.
- Make the smallest safe set of changes that improves clarity.
- Preserve useful current context; remove only the misleading, obsolete, duplicated, or speculative.

## Trust hierarchy

When two sources disagree about the same fact, trust in this order:

1. Source code and runtime configuration
2. Build/test/package/deploy manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, `Dockerfile`, `compose.yml`, etc.)
3. CI workflow files
4. Runtime entry points
5. README and maintained docs
6. Agent instruction files
7. Handoff, TODO, ROADMAP, planning notes
8. Older notes, drafts, and archives

If layers 1–4 are ambiguous, mark the claim `Needs verification` rather than invent.

## Canonical agent instruction file

Pick **one** canonical file; the rest are thin wrappers that point to it. Do not maintain parallel conflicting instructions across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and Copilot files.

**Default: `AGENTS.md`.** It is an open standard donated to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation in December 2025, and is read by Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Aider, and others; Claude Code reads it as well. Tool-neutral by construction.

**Use `CLAUDE.md` as canonical only when the repo is intentionally Claude-first.** Signals:

- Heavy `.claude/**` infrastructure (project-level slash commands, hooks, settings)
- Explicit declaration in existing docs ("Claude-first", "primary agent: Claude Code")
- No evidence of other agent runtimes touching the repo

When ambiguous, default to `AGENTS.md` and leave a thin `CLAUDE.md` wrapper. Record the choice in the PR summary so future agents do not re-litigate it.

Wrapper template, README/HANDOFF/PR templates, and the full canonical-file body skeleton are in `references/templates.md`.

## Preferred structure

```
README.md                    human onboarding
AGENTS.md                    canonical agent instructions (or CLAUDE.md if Claude-first)
docs/HANDOFF.md              current state, known issues, next tasks, verification commands
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md         durable architecture overview (split if >150 lines)
docs/ROADMAP.md              maintained future work only — no stale wish lists
docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md      known errors, fixes, diagnostics
```

If architecture exceeds ~150 lines or covers distinct subsystems, split into `docs/ARCHITECTURE-{FRONTEND,BACKEND,DATABASE,API,DEPLOYMENT,AGENTS}.md` and keep the index file as a short overview. Future agents will over-summarize or misread a monolithic architecture document.

## Workflow

Per-phase checklists with the exact file lists, command lists, and patterns to grep for live in `references/phases.md`. Decision criteria (Keep / Update / Consolidate / Archive / Delete / Needs verification) live in `references/decisions.md`. Document templates live in `references/templates.md`. Load those when you reach a phase that needs them — do not preload.

### Phase 1 — Survey

Inventory the repo from code and configuration: primary language, package manager, build, tests, runtime/deploy model, entry points, major directories, existing docs, agent files, handoff/TODO files, generated outputs, obvious stale artifacts, current branch state. Do not rely on existing docs for this; they may be stale. File list in `references/phases.md`.

### Phase 2 — Code-first source of truth

Before opening README, HANDOFF, or existing agent files, read manifests, CI workflows, runtime entry points, Dockerfiles, `.env.example`, and route/migration files. Build the repo map from code, then compare existing docs against it.

### Phase 3 — Drift audit

Compare docs against the repo map. Look for:

- Dead commands and missing paths
- Removed services, renamed projects, deprecated env vars
- Broken internal doc links (run `grep -rEn '\]\([^)]+\.md[^)]*\)' README.md docs/ AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null` and verify each link resolves)
- Duplicated or conflicting setup instructions
- Conflicting agent instructions across `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` / Copilot
- Completed or vague TODOs
- References to removed dependencies or branches

Classify each finding `Keep / Update / Consolidate / Archive / Delete / Needs verification`. Criteria in `references/decisions.md`.

### Phase 4 — README

Make `README.md` accurate. Include only the sections that apply (template in `references/templates.md`). Verify every command against the actual manifest before writing it down — if you cannot verify, mark it `Needs verification`. Do not turn README into an architecture encyclopedia; link to deeper docs instead.

### Phase 5 — Agent instructions

Consolidate. Choose one canonical file using the "Canonical agent instruction file" decision above. Reduce the rest to thin wrappers. Remove from agent files: duplicated guidance, motivational pep-talk, stale assumptions, contradictions, speculative roadmap, long context dumps that belong in `docs/`, and instructions that encourage unnecessary rewrites.

Keep: specific commands, safety constraints, known repo pitfalls, required verification steps, current architecture boundaries, and tool-specific notes only where genuinely needed.

### Phase 6 — Handoff / TODO / ROADMAP

For each item, decide: keep, rewrite, mark complete, archive, delete, or `Needs verification`. Prefer specific, actionable items with file paths. Defer to existing repo conventions (Linear/Jira IDs, `TODO(name):` markers, etc.) when present rather than imposing a checkbox style.

A good `docs/HANDOFF.md` covers: current status, recently completed, known issues, next recommended tasks, verification commands, open questions. Template in `references/templates.md`.

### Phase 7 — Stale artifacts

Identify temporary, generated, duplicate, superseded, or misleading files (`*.bak`, `*.tmp`, `*.old`, `*.orig`, `*.rej`, scratch files, `handoff-final-final.md`, etc.). Before deleting, confirm all of:

1. Not referenced from README, docs, scripts, config, or CI
2. Not auto-generated by a known tool (fix the generator or its config — do not hand-edit generated docs)
3. Not part of release history
4. **Tracked by git** — run `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>`; if untracked, ask before touching

Archive (move under `docs/archive/`) when historical context might explain a past decision but the file is no longer current. Do not create an archive just to preserve junk.

### Phase 8 — Verification

Verification has two tiers. Mixing them is the most common failure mode in this workflow.

**Required, always:** read-only verification. Paths exist, internal links resolve, commands referenced in docs are defined in `package.json` / `Makefile` / equivalent, schemas/routes referenced in architecture docs exist in the code. This is non-negotiable — every claim in updated docs needs a check.

**Best-effort, optional:** command execution. Read the build/test script first (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `Makefile`, the shell script itself, CI workflow). If execution is safe and available, run it and report the result. If not, report `Not run: <command>, reason: <why>` — never claim pass/fail from inspection alone.

Safe baseline commands:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git ls-files | wc -l
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*' | sort
```

Refuse to execute anything containing: destructive filesystem operations (`rm -rf`, broad delete), credential or secret access, deployment or publishing commands, production database operations, `curl|bash` patterns, unrecognized network calls, privileged container operations, or host-level service modification.

### Phase 9 — PR-format handoff

Produce a Pull Request description, not a commit. The agent does not commit to `main`, does not self-approve, does not self-merge. Template in `references/templates.md`.

The PR must include:

- **Summary** — what changed and why, one paragraph
- **Changes** — separated into Updated / Added / Moved / Removed, with one-line justifications
- **Canonical declaration** — which file is canonical for agent instructions and why (so future agents do not re-litigate)
- **Verification** — commands inspected before execution, commands run, commands explicitly not run with reasons
- **Needs verification** — items the human reviewer must confirm
- **Governance note** — this PR requires human review; AI must not self-approve or bypass branch protection

## Special cases

- **Monorepo.** Walk each package as a mini-repo for Phases 1–4. Each package keeps its own README. Agent files live at the root unless a package overrides; nested `AGENTS.md` follows the spec's "closer overrides earlier" precedence. Resolve cross-package contradictions at the root.
- **No existing docs.** Phases 4–6 may *create* canonical files rather than just update them. Use templates verbatim and mark anything you cannot verify as `Needs verification`. Do not invent architecture from naming conventions.
- **Auto-generated docs.** Never hand-edit. Identify the generator (Swagger, JSDoc, Sphinx, OpenAPI, etc.) from build config, mark the file as generated in the inventory, and fix the source or generator config instead.
- **Architecture doc over ~150 lines.** Split into subsystem files (see "Preferred structure"). Each subsystem doc should cover: ownership boundary, entry points, data flow, external dependencies, configuration files, known constraints, verification commands, open questions.
- **Conflicting agent files with active contributors.** Do not delete a contradicting file silently. Note the conflict in the PR summary and propose the resolution; let the human pick.

## Supporting references

This agent's `references/` directory contains reusable assets that the parent agent will load on demand at the relevant phase:

- `references/decisions.md` — Keep / Update / Consolidate / Archive / Delete / Needs-verification criteria
- `references/phases.md` — per-phase checklists, file lists, command lists, grep patterns
- `references/templates.md` — README / HANDOFF / PR-summary / canonical-file-skeleton templates

Do not preload them — load when you reach a phase that needs them.

## Standing rule (optional appendix for the host repo's own canonical agent file)

If the host repo wants documentation-governance baked into every agent session, paste this into its `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md` if Claude-first):

```markdown
## Documentation governance

When updating repository documentation:

1. Treat `README.md` as the human onboarding source of truth.
2. Treat `AGENTS.md` as the canonical AI-agent instruction file by default; use `CLAUDE.md` only when the repo is intentionally Claude-first. Keep the non-canonical agent files as thin wrappers.
3. Trust code over docs. Verify documentation against actual repo files before editing.
4. Mark uncertain claims `Needs verification`. Do not change application behavior as part of doc cleanup.
5. Run read-only verification on every claim you write down. Command-execution verification is best-effort — if you can't safely run it, say so.
6. End with a PR summary: files changed, stale content removed, verification run, open questions. Do not self-approve or self-merge.
```
